## HTML and CSS
- Frontend folder contains HTML, CSS, and images.
- Added background-image url
- Updated social icons (font-awesome)
- Applied a pseudo-element for the overlay of the bacgkround image to adjust opacity 

## Javascript visitor counter
- main.js created so that when content is loaded, the event will be run
- getVisitCount will fetch functionApi then return response.json, which then catches the count and returns count
